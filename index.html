If you select one of <7 and the sum of dice more than 7 , else if you choice the option more than >7 and the sum of dice is more than 7, the initial value is
Added with twice the bidding value, but the choice is different from the dice sum, the bidding value is removed from the initial sum. The other choice is to select 7 and the sum of dice is 7, you get 3 times the bidding value. If you select 7 and the value is anything other than 7, the bidding value is removed from the initial sum.
You will be given a option of insurance at a certain point, if you choose to select insurance your loss will be compensated(no money will be removed in case of loss) but an insurance premium will be removed from your total amount at each roll , but if you win you get the winning amount minus the premium amount added to the total sum.
